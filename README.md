# What is this?
This is ~~a project~~ my new tab page I am making.
# How do I set it?
Just download [This](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia) Chrome Extension, than you can set a custom URL, the URL you would input for this is `https://newtab.meeblox.vercel.app`, and that completes it!
# HOW DO I CHNAGE BACK!>!?!!
Chill, chill.
It's easy!
Just right click the extension (or click the three dots near the extension if you haven't pinned it lol), than click "Remove from ${Browser.Name}"
